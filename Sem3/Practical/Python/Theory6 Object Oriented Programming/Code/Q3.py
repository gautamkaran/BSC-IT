"""
Create a class called Numbers, which has a single class attribute called MULTIPLIER, and a constructor which takes the parameters x and y (these should all be numbers).
    1. Write a method called add which returns the sum of the attributes x and y.
    2. Write a class method called multiply, which takes a single number parameter a and
        returns the product of a and MULTIPLIER.
    3. Write a static method called subtract, which takes two number parameters, b and c,  and returns b - c.
    4. Write a method called value which returns a tuple containing the values of x and y. 
       Make this method into a property, and write a setter and a deleter for manipulating the values of x and y. (HOMEWORK)
